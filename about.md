I go under the alias eyJhb, as it hints some of my name plus if anyone has worked with security they will recognize it too!
I have a natural curiosity like any human being, and I continue to explore various parts of technology that I do not understand.
My main interest is cyber security, which most of my life evolves around.
My primary OS is Linux and I generally despise having to use anything else, even if required to...

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

PS: Lets not forget that I am from Denmark, and strive to change how companies in Denmark see cyber security and how the act towards breaches, holes, exploits, etc.

# About
Hi.
I am a civil engineer specialised in networks and distributed systems, but with a focus towards security.
I live in Denmark and go under the alias eyJhb, which many (including myself) is unable to pronounce in any meaningful way (but any effort is appreciated).

On this blog I'll write about various topics that interest me, which is generally related to security, technology or generally anything that I find interesting.

Feel free to contact me on IRC, I'm usually available on Libera under my alias.
